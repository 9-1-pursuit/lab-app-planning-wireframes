# App Planning Activity: Wireframes

## User Story. 

When thinking of my vet app I thought of it as a service station. I think the user would have to log in give their info before we get the pet info. As a user you would then need to add in your pet info with the option to leave it null on breed because some of us dont know. From the pets the user can pick the service requested which goes back to the staff. 

When thinking of staff I figured people pick up shifts so it would have to account for where the staff is. If they're in when they're out and location. After that employees can see the services that go to the pet. When thinking of services I figure that they can have many services at once so one or many to many was a coice. 

Knowing all this I created an app that the user can impliment as such. There would be a sign up or log in. From there after filling everything out they will have pages for their/their pets info and a way to speak to staff and details on a home screen such as services and upcoming appointmens

## What I came up with

## Origional task: 

Think back to the [Veterinarian API](./veterinarian-api-description.md) - use this app description as a reference to plan a new version of this app.

- Create a wireframe for at least two views based on your user stories.
- You may use an online tool or paper to draw your wireframes. If you draw your wireframes on paper, you will need to take a photo and upload an image to share.

Submit links to your wireframes on Canvas.

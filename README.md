# App Planning Activity: Wireframes

## Planning a simple app

Think back to the [Veterinarian API](./veterinarian-api-description.md) - use this app description as a reference to plan a new version of this app.

- Create a wireframe for at least two views based on your user stories.
- You may use an online tool or paper to draw your wireframes. If you draw your wireframes on paper, you will need to take a photo and upload an image to share.

Submit links to your wireframes on Canvas.
